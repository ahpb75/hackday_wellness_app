# hackday_wellness_app

This is our State Farm 2016 Hack Day Project. We created a corporate wellness iOS app called FitFarm.

FitFarm focuses on building a community that enables healthy lifestyle choices by allowing employees to:

1) view and track their personal health stats fed from the iPhone Health API
2) search for and subscribe to community challenges in various health categories
3) view the enterprise's daily progress, join groups to team up with others, and attend events that support the local community.

Please see the .mp4 for an app walkthrough and presentation.
